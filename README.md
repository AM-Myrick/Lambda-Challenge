# Precourse Assessment

This assessment assumes prior knowledge and provides an opportunity for advanced students to bypass the precourse requirements.
If the questions in here are too difficult then you can begin working through our precourse work which has [here](https://github.com/LambdaSchool/Precourse).
If you are completely new to programming then you should begin by working through the precourse repo linked to above.
At that link you will also have the opportunity to register for one of our live classes that covers this material in depth
and you will also get access to Lambda School's TAs to assist you with preparing for the full-time immersive program.

Pending a final interview, those that complete this challenge successfully will be invited to attend Lambda School without paying anything upfront; no loans, no debt, and no upfront tuition. 
Pay nothing at all until you're making $50k+ as a software engineer.

## Prerequisites

You will need to download Node in order to run the automated tests.  You can download Node [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
You will also need to have git installed on your computer in order to clone the repository.  You can download it [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

In order to complete this assessment you will need to have a basic understanding of the following concepts:
```
JavaScript
  variables
  if statements
  for loops
  functions
  arrays
  objects
  math operators
  equality and logical operators
Git/GitHub
  fork
  clone
  add
  commit
  push
  pull request
Command Line (Terminal on Mac or Command Prompt on Windows)
  navigation (ls, dir, cd)
  running git commands
```
## Instructions


Fork this repo to your GitHub account.

Clone the forked copy to your local computer by using this command in the terminal/command prompt:  `git clone <forked repo url>`

Navigate into the cloned repo and install the node modules with this command: `npm i`

Run the automatic tests to make sure everything is working: `npm test`.  You should see a bunch of failing tests.

Follow the instructions in `assessment.js`.  Run `npm test` to test your code.  As you complete the requirements the tests will start to pass. 

After getting all of the tests to pass you need to `add`, `commit`, and `push` your code with the following commands:
```
git add --all
git commit -m "Completed assessment"
git push
```
You will need to execute the above commands from within the directory that you cloned.

Once you have pushed your changes you need to submit a pull request back to the original repository.

We will verify that the tests pass and will send you an email to schedule an interview.
