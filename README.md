# Lambda Challenge 

In order to remove even more barriers for those that want to participate in Lambda School, we've created the Lambda Challenge.

Based on our data, we are confident that if you can complete the Lambda Challenge, we can help you learn to code, and get a job as a developer. We're willing to bet on you.

Pending a final interview, those that complete the Lambda Challenge successfully may be invited to attend Lambda School without paying anything upfront; no loans, no debt, and no upfront tuition. 
Pay nothing at all until you're making $50k+ as a software engineer.

After the completion of the Lambda Challenge, we'll schedule you for a priority interview, and you can skip the pre-course work that we normally require.

If the questions in here are too difficult then you can begin working through our regular precourse work which covers the fundamentals [here](https://github.com/LambdaSchool/Precourse).

## Prerequisites

You will need to download Node in order to run the automated tests.  You can download Node [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
You will also need to have git installed on your computer in order to clone the repository.  You can download it [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

In order to complete this assessment you will need to have a basic understanding of the following concepts:
```
JavaScript
  variables
  if statements
  for loops
  functions
  arrays
  objects
  math operators
  equality and logical operators
Git/GitHub
  fork
  clone
  add
  commit
  push
  pull request
Command Line (Terminal on Mac or Command Prompt on Windows)
  navigation (ls, dir, cd)
  running git commands
```
## Instructions


Fork this repo to your GitHub account.

Clone the forked copy to your local computer by using this command in the terminal/command prompt:  `git clone <forked repo url>`

Navigate into the cloned repo and install the node modules with this command: `npm i`

Run the automatic tests to make sure everything is working: `npm test`.  You should see a bunch of failing tests.

Follow the instructions in `assessment.js`.  Run `npm test` to test your code.  As you complete the requirements the tests will start to pass. 

After getting all of the tests to pass you need to `add`, `commit`, and `push` your code with the following commands:
```
git add --all
git commit -m "Completed assessment"
git push
```
You will need to execute the above commands from within the directory that you cloned.

Once you have pushed your changes you need to submit a pull request back to the original repository.

We will verify that the tests pass and will send you an email to schedule an interview.
